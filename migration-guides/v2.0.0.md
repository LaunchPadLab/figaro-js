## v2.0.0 Migration Guide

The only breaking change in this version is that `Figaro` now throws an exception when loading invalid or malformed files. This shouldn't require any migrations, but in the (unlikely) case that behavior was being depended on, you can catch the error:
```js
try {
  Figaro.load()
} catch (e) {}
```
